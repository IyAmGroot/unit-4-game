# unit-4-game

Goal
Create a role player game.

Technical Details
Page constructed using HTML.  Page was styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.  Page elements were manipulated, music and sound effects were played using Javascript/jQuery.  

Click the start button to begin the game.


All,

Please excuse the button to start the game.  It's the only way I could come up with that would allow me to play the audio they way I wanted.  Chrome prohibits playing audio without user interaction.  A good feature for a browser I suppose, but it screws me over for this assignment.  Clicking the button allows me to play the audio as the page appears to open.  

I also get a weird error in the Dev Tools regarding the .ttf I'm using.  Everything seems to work the way I want, but I couldn't find a way to get rid of the message in the console.  

Thanks!
Eric
